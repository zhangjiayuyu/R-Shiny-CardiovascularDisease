# R-Shiny-CardiovascularDisease

This R project is for MGMT 590 - Using R for Analytics at Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, developed by team: Jiayu Zhang, Jason Chen, Vinni Guan and Rohit Soans.

We build an app to predict the probability of heart disease in a given individual. This app will be an asset in the hands of sales teams for Health Insurance Companies.  Sales agents can use the app during their sales pitches. On hearing what is the probability that they may get a heart attack, most people are likely to be garner strong interest in Health Insurance products. We found a Cardiovascular dataset on Kaggle with 70,000 observations. We explored and transformed our data and build a model to predict the probability of heart disease.
